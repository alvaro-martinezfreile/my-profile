            <p>Travelling extensively for education, leisure, and work related ventures has endowed me with a unique skill set and a comprehensive understanding of the luxury industry. My experiences in Spain, The United Kingdom, Ecuador Ghana, The Netherlands and Switzerland, amongst others, have honed my ability to build strong cross-cultural relationships despite language barriers and to thrive in fast-paced environments. These experiences have also deepened my appreciation of strong brand identity, heritage, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. This is my professional life!</p>
